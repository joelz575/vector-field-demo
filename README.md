# vector-field-demo
Java application to demonstrate what vector fields are and how they work

uses [exp4j](http://projects.congrace.de/exp4j/download.html), a free library for evaluating functions

## Features
* Visualize vector field of arbitrary 2D vector-valued function
* Click to drop a point that "flows" through the field
* Click and hold, dragging a rectangular region, to drop a rectangle that will also "flow" through the field
* When there is a point, see instantaneous values (Values tab)
* Change window size to better visualize function

## Controls
Function
> As a 2D vector-valued function, it has an i-vector component and a j-vector component, both of which are functions of x and y

> Any valid function of x and y will be accepted, including trigonometric functions; anything that [exp4j supports](http://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/#Built-in_functions)
